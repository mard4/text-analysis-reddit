# Text Analysis Reddit
Reddit Analysis of Character.ai Interactions. Analyzed Reddit discussions on Character.ai to understand the community behaviour.
This study investigates public perceptions of Character.ai, a platform for chatting with AI characters, using data collected from Reddit. Through demographic analysis, topic modeling with LDA, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the research identifies key themes of user engagement: escapism, support-based interactions, and assistance. Special focus is given to therapy-related discussions, where the term "comfort" emerges as a significant concept. A semantic network further maps the associations and relationships of "comfort," offering insights into the platform's role in user well-being.

This project is the final personal project for the Computational Social Sciences course at the University of Trento.
